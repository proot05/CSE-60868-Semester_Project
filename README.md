# Conceptual Design: 3D Point Cloud Enhancement for On-the-Fly 3D Printer Control
## Description
To 3D print on a dynamic surface, a six-axis robotic arm utilizes a high frequency depth and color camera to create a 3D point cloud of the surface to be printed on. This allows the printer to observe the shape change of the surface for a period of time and use that data to predict the shape of the surface at the time of the next point it needs to print using a RNN algorithm. However, this workflow faces some challenges due to the variation in quality of the 3D point clouds produced by the camera. As the camera is high frequency, it is inherently low resolution. Additionally, the camera produces point clouds that are perticaularly noisy in the vertical direction and the camera is incapable of filling in all differently colored areas of the surface given specific lighting and exposure settings. Therefore, in order to perform more precise control of the printer a pipeline for denoising, completing, and umsampling 3D point clouds will be create in this project.

## Datasets
Vast collections of datasets, including both synthetic and real-world objects, exsist talored toward training models to carry out each of the three enhancement goals (denoising, completing, and umsampling). As the application is focussed on interacting with real-world objects, these datasets will be the focus, however, it is a concern that the main area of application for this printer (printing on a beating heart) will be too far outside the scope of the objects included in these databases. Some examples of datasets containing real-world objects and ground truth pairs considered for these goals are: [denoising](https://wang-ps.github.io/denoising.html), [completing](https://github.com/yushuang-wu/SCoDA) *synthetic objects, and [upsampling](https://github.com/hkust-vgd/scanobjectnn). These datasets are all very large and can be broken into sections for training and validation. The data for testing the model will come from conducting scans with the robotic arm printer.
